Bank class additions: 

writeToFile(PrintWriter pw){
	
	for(/* all BankAccounts */){
		accounts[i].writeToFile(pw);
		Print like this: " Adolfas|Lapsys|Address|balance|username|pin thats coded "
	}
}
readFrom(Scanner s){
	while(s.hasNextLine()){
		BankAccount b = new BankAccount(s);//create default constructor so this is empty
	}		
}

BankAccount readFromFile(Scanner s){
	String[] arr = s.nextLine().split("|");
}
pin : dont store the actual pin, store some encoded version of the pin
	Replace pin with hashOfPIN
		private String PIN;//remove!!!
		private String hashOfPIN;
ArrayList<BankAcount> accounts; equivalent to c++ vectors{
	grow method isnt needed any more bc arrayList takes care of it
