Bugs : There are still many bugs I will be trying to fix, but overall I put a lot more time into thinking about what the code should do before i wrote it. I think its neater, more readable, and it works better with less bugs then my first submission. Thanks for spending time to grade this, i hope it was clear enough. I know i need to modularize the change account info functions as well as the the handling of the pin(it works but there are mistakes for sure). Please let me know what other bugs you have found. 
THANK YOU !

For the writeToFile func, i use it to write all of the accounts to the given file
For the readFromFile func, i use it to read accounts from the given file and create new accounts from it.
